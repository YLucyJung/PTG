# Workflow 
This page decribes scripts and data used for the analysis of PTG (parathyroid gland) chromatin and expression data. 

Due to the data size, datasets required for `1_expression_gcm2_analysis.r` and `4_ptg_genes_chromatin_expression.r` can be downloaded [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/rtwdt0nd6e6p1jg666gph/h?rlkey=cesecj7intlh9zc1y9czlnumz&dl=0).

## PTG expression compared to other tissues
`1_expression_gcm2_analysis.r` takes input of gene expression levels from 8 PTG individuals and compared them with those from other tissues in GTEX. `f1.data.RData` contains PTG gene expression data as well GTEX data. The clustering and visualization was done based on PTG-spepcifically expressed genes.
