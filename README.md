# Chromatin Landscape of Human Parathyroids

## About
In this studay, we investigated the chromatin landscape in human parathyroid. This site contains codes and data for the analysis of human parathyroid chromatin and transcriptomic data. Step-by-step analysis procedures are described [here](/docs/Workflow.md), and the associated scripts and data are deposited. The data includes gene expression levels, chromatin state annotations, and Hi-C chromatin interactions. The raw data sets can be obtained from [dbGaP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs003302.v1.p1) through requests, and other processed files can be downloaded from the supplementary tables of the following paper.
