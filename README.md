# Chromatin Landscape of Human Parathyroids

In this studay, we investigated the chromatin landscape in human parathyroid. This site contains codes and data for the analysis of human parathyroid chromatin and transcriptomic data. Step-by-step analysis procedures are described [here](/docs/Workflow.md), and the associated scripts and data are deposited. The data includes gene expression levels, chromatin state annotations, and Hi-C chromatin interactions. The raw data sets cound be obtained from [dbGaP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs003302.v1.p1) through requests and other processed files can be downloaded from the supplementary tables from the following paper.
